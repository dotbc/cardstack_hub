This directory is for modules that support `../indexers.js`, the main code within the Hub that runs all your Indexers and gets content into the search index.

Not to be confused with the `../indexers` directory, which follows standard Cardstack plugin semantics to define some Indexers that come with `@cardstack/hub` itself.
